# Unspendy

This is a budgeting system that I am building for our family. To reduce scope
I am making it very specific to our use case. I'm open sourcing it with the hope
of being able to learn in public.

## Intended main features

- Upload CSV of transactions
- Create categories
- Assign budgets to categories
- Categorize transactions
- Calculate how much can be spent in each category each week
